bio: Dr. Binder’s research centers on the analysis of high-dimensional, -omic data to generate novel insight into the molecular mechanisms that shape cancer incidence. A major motivation of her work is the potential of epigenetic epidemiology to elucidate the pathway by which stimuli during critical exposure windows can exert a long-term influence on risk profiles.
