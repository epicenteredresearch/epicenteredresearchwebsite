Adolescence is a critical period in life when the body is changing rapidly and is vulnerable to chemical exposures. Because evidence suggests that the seeds of breast cancer may be sown early in life, the Early Life exposures in Latina Adolescents (ELLA) study hopes to find out whether exposure to common environmental chemicals during puberty leads to changes in the breast that could increase a young girlâ€™s chances of developing breast cancer later in life.
